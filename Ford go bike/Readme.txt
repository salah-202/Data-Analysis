Go for bike ford dataset it contains almost 183000 oservations
about it contions the duration of each trip the start time the end time,start statio and end station
the birth year of users ,the gender of each user and if they customers or subscriber 
the data can be found here(https://www.kaggle.com/chirag02/ford-gobike-data-analysis/data)

## summary of findings

in the exploration i found customers spend more time than subscriber 
and the relationn between age and duration it's positive colration and for users 
birth year between 85s and 95s they spend higher durations and regardless
the number of men more then women but women spend more time in trip and 
there is no customers share bike for all trip just 10% of subscriber users
share bike for all trip.

##key insights for the presintation

now we have three important insights about the data ,
first we know excatly which time users most take in by hour,day and month 
the most trips take in 7 O,Cloak and 17 O,Cloak , Thursday is the most day users take in,
and all trips take in Febraury month
second the avrage time for trip is about 450 sec for after avoiding the outliers that can be 24 hours
we can see the avrage time for trip is about 6 minutes 
fainlly is the avrage time for customer and subscriber after calculting it in the pravious step now i wanna know 
who take more time in avrage customer or subscriber and I got that customer take about 100 sec more than subscriber.
